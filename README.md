Nightfall is a proxy that uses Ultraviolet, BareMux, and Epoxy to free the internet of censorship blah blah blah... okay yeah I give up. You use this to get past school filters, gogaurdian, securly, all that stuff. Hell it even works if your school uses ARISTOTLE... for some reason.

Oh yeah theres games too.
